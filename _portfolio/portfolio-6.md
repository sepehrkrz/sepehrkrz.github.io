## Key Contributions

- Developed a new fault detection method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Utilized Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of faulty signals as input to the CNN
- Achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods

## Deep Learning Approach

### CNN Architecture

The proposed method employs a deep CNN with the following structure:

- Input: Gray-scale images (129x8x1) derived from signal PSDs
- 3 Convolutional layers
- 2 Max-pooling layers
- 1 Fully-connected layer
- Output: SoftMax layer for classification

### Key Features

1. **Feature Extraction**: The CNN automatically extracts discriminative features from the PSD images, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

2. **Hierarchical Learning**: The network learns both general and detailed features through its multiple layers.

3. **Adaptability**: The model can be trained on various analog circuits, making it versatile for different fault detection scenarios.

## Results

The proposed deep learning method outperformed existing techniques:

- First Circuit Under Test (CUT):
  - Scenario 1: 99.8% accuracy (vs. 98.73% for next best method)
  - Scenario 2: 97.8% accuracy (vs. 94.3% for next best method)
- Second CUT: 93% accuracy (vs. 87.9% for next best method)

## Implications
